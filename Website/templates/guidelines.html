    <h2>Guidelines for Successful Upload</h2>

</div>

<div>
    <p>
        
        <br>To ensure a successful upload, please make sure ALL submissions comply with the following guidelines. 


        <br> Files with a large number of rows may not upload. Files less than 1 MB should all upload properly, but files larger may currently cause the server to time out. We are working to expand the accepted file sizes largely.

<br>Form submissions deviating from these guidelines will likely fail to be uploaded when processed:
<br>Processing script URLs cannot contain the percent symbol (%)
<br>If the processing script comes from Jupyter notebook, the best way to avoid this error is to rename the Jupyter Notebook file without any spaces – Spaces can be replaced with dashes or underscores instead

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>Files deviating from these guidelines will likely fail to be uploaded when processed:
<br>All files must be tab-separated
<br>No files can contain NA values – the submission will fail
<br>Files must NOT include a header (i.e. no column names)
<br>Files cannot have duplicate submission titles. If you receive an error regarding duplicate submission titles, please return to the ‘Contribute’ page and change your submission title 

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>GMT Files should follow the following format for successful submission:
<br>Standard GMT format
<br>Column 1: Kinase/Protein/Transcription Factor of Interest
<br>Naming of the FIRST term
<br>No terms can be over 225 characters long
<br>terms with multiple words as part of the name should NOT be separated by underscore or dash → If multiple words are part of the name, separate by spaces or by periods (.)
<br>Next to the term, place an underscore (_) and write the species name of the term
<br>if multiple words are part of the term name, please make sure this underscore with species is the LAST part written
<br>Column 2: Description
<br>No spaces in this column (must be a single word)
<br>Can be left empty (although an additional tab would still be necessary between the gene set name and its terms), but for reliable performance use ‘None’ if no description
<br>Columns 3→ 
<br>All interaction proteins, each in their own column (variable number of columns per kinase/protein/transcription factor)
<br>These terms are only the gene symbol (no indication of species needed as with the first term)
<br>No terms can be over 225 characters long
<br>Example GMT File
<br>An example of a GMT file whose format is accepted and can be successfully submitted is found on the ‘HELP’ page of BioNetBay

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>SIG Files should follow the following format for successful submission:
<br>Standard SIG format
<br>All SIG files MUST have 13 columns corresponding to:
<br>source name
<br>source human accession
<br>source mouse accession
<br>source type
<br>source location
<br>target name
<br>target human accession
<br>target mouse accession
<br>target type
<br>target location
<br>effect
<br>type of interaction
<br>PubMed IDs

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>Bolded columns (columns 1 and columns 6) MUST include source name and the target name
<br>All other columns can simply be listed as NA
<br>None of the names can be over 225 characters long
<br>Example SIG file
<br>An example of a SIG file whose format is accepted and can be successfully submitted is found on the ‘HELP’ page of BioNetBay
